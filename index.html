<h1>
Wine Tasting</h1>
Tasting wine is both an exploration, to find and enjoy different wines,
and an examination, to identify and describe specific elements of a wine's
character. It's purpose can range from the predictive, where a wine merchant
must decide which newly fermented wine will grow to be the most marketable,
to the judgemental, where differing producers or vintages compete against
each other for attention, to the analytical, where enthusiasts attempt
to describe their perceptions to others.
<p>In all of these, the practice of wine tasting revolves around the senses
of:
<ul>
<li>
<a href="#sight">Sight</a></li>

<li>
<a href="#odor">Odor</a></li>

<li>
<a href="#taste">Taste</a></li>

<p>
<hr><a NAME="sight"></a>
<h2>
Sight</h2>
Wines can not be judged on appearances independently of odor and flavor,
but off colors can alert us to suspect defects in wines. Be wary of bad
lighting conditions; tilt your glass against a white background to examine
the wine's gradations of colors and clarity.
<h4>
Surface</h4>
The surface of the wine in the glass, its "disc", can give some first hints
about the quality of the wine. It should be bright and free from any dust
or solid matter. If the surface is dull or matte, something will probably
be found wrong with the wine's taste.
<h4>
White Wine Colors</h4>
No wine is truly colorless, most have at least a bare hint of some color.
As a white wine ages, it usually darkens, turning amber or brown. However,
some very dark white wines, such as Marsala, lighten with age.
<ul>
<li>
<b><i>yellow-green</i></b> - common in young whites due to residual chlorophyll
and characteristic of Chablis of Mosel. Rarely seen from hot climates.</li>

<li>
<b><i>straw-yellow</i></b> - common color, particularly in dry whites.</li>

<li>
<b><i>yellow-gold</i></b> - common in sweet wines, Sauternes, German Pr&auml;dikats.
Certainly abnormal in young, dry wines.</li>

<li>
<b><i>gold</i></b> - a lusciously sweet wine or one with much bottle age.</li>

<li>
<b><i>yellow-brown</i></b> - seen in many dessert and fortified wines.</li>

<li>
<b><i>amber-brown</i></b> - indicative of an over-mature wine, considerable
bottle age, or even oxidation.</li>

<li>
<b><i>madeirized</i></b> - a drab, pallid, yellow-brown color indicating
oxidation; not disastrous, but unpleasant.</li>

<li>
<b><i>brown</i></b> - probably well past drinking.</li>

<li>
other descriptive terms - <b><i>lemon-yellow, white gold, red gold, bronze,
topaz, burnt topaz, caramel, mahogany</i></b></li>
</ul>

<h4>
Ros&eacute; Wine Colors</h4>

<ul>
<li>
<b><i>pink</i></b> - true color of ros&eacute; wines.</li>

<li>
<b><i>orange</i></b> - an off color, sometimes the color of a Grenache
ros&eacute;.</li>

<li>
<b><i>brown</i></b> or <b><i>tawny</i></b> - over-aged or oxidized.</li>

<li>
<b><i>purple</i></b> - often indicates a low acid ros&eacute;, may taste
flat.</li>

<li>
other descriptive terms - <b><i>grey, light red, violet, russet, salmon
pink</i></b></li>
</ul>

<h4>
Red Wine Colors</h4>
Red wines often lighten with age, turning softer and more tawny in color.
<ul>
<li>
<b><i>purple</i></b> - extreme youth and immaturity.</li>

<li>
<b><i>ruby</i></b> - young, red wine.</li>

<li>
<b><i>red</i></b> - traditional claret color at medium age.</li>

<li>
<b><i>brick-red, tile-red</i></b> - medium aged, mature red.</li>

<li>
<b><i>red brown </i></b>- mature red wine or from a particularly hot vintage
or some oxidation.</li>

<li>
<b><i>mahogany</i></b> - considerable maturity.</li>

<li>
<b><i>tawny</i></b> - associated with a kind of port.</li>

<li>
<b><i>amber-brown</i></b> - considerable age; presumably old and/or oxidized.</li>

<li>
<b><i>black</i></b> - some red wines from certain grapes in hot climates
produce a wine that is very dark.</li>

<li>
other descriptive terms - <b><i>garnet, vermillion, tile-red, maroon</i></b></li>
</ul>

<h4>
Depth of Color</h4>
White wines - depth of color in dry whites is relatively unimportant. The
deep gold of sweet wines should not be confused with the brown tint that
indicates oxidation.
<p>Red wines - A very deep, nearly opaque wine will have much tannins and
other natural components derived from rich, ripe grapes. A pale red results
from too high a yield per acre, a poor year, or hasty vinification.
<ul>
<li>
descriptive terms - <b><i>light, weak, poor, faded, pale, true, consistent,
ample, rich, dense, heavy, deep, opaque</i></b></li>
</ul>

<h4>
Clarity</h4>
Suspended material usually indicates defects in odor or flavor. But, some
cloudiness or deposit maybe from normal aging. White wines develop a deposit
only after many years. Amber dessert wines deposit some colored material
with time. Red wines get a fine colloidal haze with aging that eventually
falls to the sides or bottom and results in a loss of depth of color.
<ul>
<li>
<b><i>blind</i></b> - a lack of clarity, an unsettled cloudiness.</li>

<li>
<b><i>bright</i></b> - crystal clear.</li>

<li>
<b><i>brilliant</i></b> - impeccably clear.</li>

<li>
<b><i>cloudy</i></b> - not clear; something is wrong with this wine.</li>

<li>
<b><i>dull</i></b> - not bright.</li>

<li>
<b><i>hazy</i></b> - slightly clear, may be off.</li>

<li>
<b><i>limpid</i></b> - absolutely clear and start-bright.</li>
</ul>

<h4>
Sediment</h4>
Sediment is caused by the natural reaction of tannin with the coloring
compounds in a wine. It is harmless, indicates a good deal of age, and
is naturally accompanied by a loss of depth of color as well as harshness
of taste. Common in most red wines and especially old ports. Usually a
good reason to decant a wine.
<h4>
Legs or Tears</h4>
After a wine is swirled in the glass, drops of clear wine will be observed
trickling down the sides. Some say this is a capillary effect caused by
the difference in surface tension between alcohol and water; others say
it is related to a wine's viscosity and the amount of glycerine in the
liquid. Many place a great deal of importance on their appearance - the
better the wine, the more noticeable the legs or tears - the rest don't.&nbsp;
<hr><a NAME="odor"></a>
<h2>
Odor</h2>
Our appreciation of wine is due mainly to its odor because our olfactory
system can distinguish between thousands of delicate traces of chemical
compounds. A quick, forceful sniff diverts air over the sensitive regions
in the nasal cavity, but wait a few seconds between sniffs to re-sensitize
the nose. Twirl the glass lightly to expose the wine to air which will
release the various aromatic components. Be aware of the odor of the wine
once it is warmed up in the mouth; most of what we call taste is a result
of warmed odors creeping into the olfactory passages.
<p>Aroma is derived from the grape variety itself acquired during fermentation
in contact with the skin. It is usually more pronounced in younger wines.
Bouquet is derived from fermentation, processing, and aging.

<hr><a NAME="taste"></a>
<h2>
Taste</h2>
The sense of taste is located entirely on the tongue. The best wines will
have a balance of flavors providing a complex taste. To savor a wine's
full flavor, sip a little wine, then whistle in some air over your slightly
curled tongue.
<p>Of the four main tastes, sweetness is due to glucose and fructose and
to some extent glycerol and ethanol. Sweetness tends to mask certain other
negative odors and tastes. Fresh white wines should have a delicate balance
of sweetness and acidity.
<p>Sourness is the tart, acidic taste of wines. Common acids present in
wine in order of tartness: tartaric, citric, malic, and lactic.
<p>Bitterness derives from polyphenolic compounds such as tannin and should
not be confused with astringency or too much acidity. White wines are usually
not bitter. Red wines with a lot of polyphenols age better, so a young
bitter red will probably age well into a more mellow taste.
<p>Saltiness is almost never noted in wines.
<ul>

<b><i>acetic</i></b> - sharp, over-tart flavor from a wine left exposed
to air.</li>

<li>

<hr><a NAME="touch"></a>
<h2>
Touch</h2>

Astringency</h4>
Astringency is the dry, puckering sensation due to polyphenols such as
tannin. Always a negative factor in white wines. Astringency of young red
table wines decreases with aging.

<b><i>thin</i></b> - lacking body and ethanol.</li>

<li>
<b><i>unctuous</i></b> - oily and viscous.</li>

<li>
<b><i>velvety</i></b> - more rich than smooth.</li>
</ul>

<h4>
Carbon Dioxide</h4>
The prickly sensation of the bubbles in a sparkling wine are caused by
dissolved carbon dioxide. The best sparkling wines have small bubbles that
are generated quickly and consistently.
